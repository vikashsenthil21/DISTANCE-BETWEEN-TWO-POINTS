# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the two values from the user
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
Using the slicing concept rotate the lis
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
  ```

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```

### OUTPUT:

![distance between two point](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119433834/212457111-d71be5ae-6d1d-4732-b1c3-f09c50c58972.png)

### RESULT:
Thus the distance-between-two-point are successfully executed
